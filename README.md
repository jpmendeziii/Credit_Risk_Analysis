# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. Six different methods were utilized.

* 1. Naive Random Oversampling
* 2. SMOTE Oversampling
* 3. Cluster Centroid Undersampling
* 4. SMOTEENN Sampling
* 5. Balanced Random Forest Classifying
* 6. Easy Ensemble Classifying

Through each of these methods, the data was split into training and testing datasets. Accuracy scores, confusion matrices and classification reports were compiled in summary form.
